Well is emotional therapy alright?Why do you even need more details?*Sigh* Ok but keep this between us.Do you know how milipeds have many... feet. Well all of my partners have been obsessed with them. Every milipede does!The problem is...I JUST HATE FEET. Why does everyone need to like them. Every intimate moment leads to a mention of these.. nightmare limb ends. There is no way out. I need therapy. I just want to feel comfortable around my own species again man.I'm losing it."
