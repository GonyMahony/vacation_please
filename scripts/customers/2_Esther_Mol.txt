So, to start, you should know that I am a glasses-tester, and I take my job very seriously. I work with the prestigious glasses-maker Vi Shon and he relies on my skills for his artisanship. Recently, I have been befallen by a vicious cataract impairing my work. I had to pay the doctors 5000 coins to remedy my situation and resume work. As per my contract, I therefore ask for a payout of this sum.
