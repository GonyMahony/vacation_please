Hi, glad I made it here! See just got blind because of my cataract and I just got a bill from the hospital? It is because they failed my laser surgery, plus I am insured and this should be covered by the insurance! I hope this is just a dumb misunderstanding because I will not pay someone for making me blind. If anything, I will sue this damn hospital if the follow up surgery does not help.
