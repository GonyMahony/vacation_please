So I was takin' a walk the other day. I remember I was conflicted about talking to the man at the garden cleaning his swimming pool. I don't know how to make friends, i'm a lonely soul. I just stood, silently upon a hill, but ultimately, I decided to overcome my fear and pride. After 10 sessions of therapy due to peer pressure, I finally had that breakthrough, and it really felt alright. We laughed together, we cried together, and even though I was completely out of my element, I was euphoric by the end. I am done asking myself whether I put enough work in. I'm glad I went to therapy, it just wasn't for free and I didn't come from a silver spoon you know? Sadly, contractually I am only entitled to a single 50 coins bill from you, so that is what i am asking for.
