Greetings.
I'm here to request coverage for my post birth trauma therapy.
I was born through a horrifying and tragic separation from my brother. Very scarring. Very emotional. Very true.
...
Okay maybe it's a bit more complex than that. See we are technically the same worm. but hey, identity is complicated okay?
Anyway I need the payout. My brother and I are still sorting out our... differences.
And by that I mean he's digesting lunch while I'm doing the hard work and begging here for money.

Please... help two worms out.
