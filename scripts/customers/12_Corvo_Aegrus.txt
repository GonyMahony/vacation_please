Caw—caw—caw!
*Achoo!*... sorry, had some feathers stuck in there.
...
Right. Hello.
I am here on behalf of myself to formally request funding for my wasp-venom hyposensitization treatment. My life is in constant danger.
I go out and I have to keep watching my back FOR THESE FLYING VESSELS OF HORROR. You never know when they’ll attack me!
Honestly, if there were a wasp in this room right now, I could just... *thunk* ... drop dead on the floor.
Imagine, my life. GONE!

So, please. Help a poor crow survive another day.
