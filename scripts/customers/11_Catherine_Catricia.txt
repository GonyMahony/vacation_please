Okay, so, listen. I’ve got Severe Ocular… uh… Oculiartites and I can barely see a thing! I know, I know. I somehow made it all the way to your desk, but that’s because I’ve got ears. And whiskers. And a nose so sharp I could smell your stink from ten blocks away.

I may not see you clearly, but trust me. I sense everything.
I just… need the money for this eye surgery. Please. My vision is going downhill faster than my dignity.
