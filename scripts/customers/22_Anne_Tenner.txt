Hello representative Papa Seal. I am being exposed to an excessive amount of radiation. I know it was made by the government, I just can't quite prove it. In either case, my Ossicones are very sensitive to this particular kind of radiation and have developed a horrible cancer, but fortunately, conveniently, it has been treated perfectly without leaving a trace. This ultra high-quality procedure cost me a hefty sum of money however at a very reputable doctor, but unfortunately I have lost the receipt. I still demand re-imbursement as per my contract though!
