text = "Good day to you. I'm so excited to finally be here! I recently went on a wonderful walk through the forest, it was amazing, there were so many things to discover and I ran into this cat that I chased for 2 hours straight, so exctiting! Ah, but I caught a case of Borelliosis while I was there. But it was totally worth it, it was such a great day! Anyway, it cost me 670 to treat and I think reading the contract that I should be able to get that covered here. Does it work that way? I really hope it does, 670 coins would allow me to afford such cool things!"
