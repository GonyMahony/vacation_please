Uhm, this is difficult to talk about.
So I'm just going to keep it brief and request a payout for therapy.
...
You need more than that? Well is emotional therapy alright?
Why do you even need more details?
*Sigh* Ok but keep this between us.
Do you know how milipeds have many... feet. Well all of my partners have been obsessed with them. Every milipede does!
The problem is...
I JUST HATE FEET. Why does everyone need to like them. Every intimate moment leads to a mention of these.. nightmare limb ends. There is no way out. 
I need therapy. I just want to feel comfortable around my own species again man.
I'm losing it.
