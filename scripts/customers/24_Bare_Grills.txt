Hello representative Seal. A few weeks ago I went on a high-endurance, high-stress, high-stakes, high-difficulty, high-intensity survival tour and sustained a slight injury, nothing too serious. Then I did it again and got injured in the same spot, and this time I had to get treatment, even though my body is so strong! This cost me a thousand coins, and I heard I can get this money back from you?
